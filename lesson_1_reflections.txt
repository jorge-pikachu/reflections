How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It can help in differents ways
for example:
1. Finding errors in a fast and easy way
2. Saveing time for others assignments

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You can check errors 
restore previous versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is exclusively for code, but Google Docs is for Documents and other stuff.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can use them, comparing different versions of a file and the changes between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because is easy to return to a previous version using checkout

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
my first Android App :)
